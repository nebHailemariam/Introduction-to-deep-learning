# Introduction to Deep Learning (IDL) 11-785

This repo contains my **TA solutions** for the **graduate-level course 11-785: Introduction to Deep Learning**. This is one of the most intense courses at CMU, and I was very fortunate to be a teaching assistant for it after taking the course. The course is currently being taught to over **350+ students**.

The course covers both the basics and advanced topics of **Deep Learning**, including **neural networks**, **optimizations**, and architectures **attention-based models**. In the first parts of each homework, students implement various neural networks from scratch using only **numpy**, such as **FFN**, **RNN**, and **GRU**. In the second parts, they use **PyTorch** and learn to **hyperparameter tune** to solve tasks like **language modeling** and **automatic speech recognition (ASR)**.
